Graphis and logos related to Embarcadero Delphi's [Visual Component Library (**VCL**)](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/VCL)

In the early version of Delphi when you created a new VCL component, the default icon was a cube, sphere, and cone.  

I really think the measurement and drafting lines added a nice effect, but I've included a version without too.
